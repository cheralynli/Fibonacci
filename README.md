This code calculates the nth number of this sequence. This sequence is similar to the fibonacci series, however, with a twist.

The first 3 numbers (2, 1, 3) are fixed; The fourth number is calculated as the product of the first two numbers. The rest of the numbers in the following sequence will follow the same pattern.

I used this to practice my recursive methods in python.
